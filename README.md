# rustsudoku
A sudoku solver written in Rust.

There are no dependencies, but Rust 1.7.0 was used to compile this. To compile and run:

```rust
rustc sudoku.rs
./sudoku.rs
```

This project will be complete when it can:

* Pre-populate from either a grid or a list of values/positions
* Solve boards of various sizes, e.g. 25x25 instead of just the usual 9x9.
